## Overview
This page build was an attempt to recreate a news page, it consisted of three main files used: Assets, index.html, and style.css.
This readme takes use of backgound colors, text elements (such as h1, p1), img properties (to adjust size) and an svg (for the logo)

### The challenge

The challenge for this build was to format and positioniing items and divs. Positioning divs were difficult, i was attempting to make use of inline-block hoping that the child elements would display in an inline format but it did not, so what i did was creating excess child elements and making column and row formats for each child individually, altho it works, it may not be the most ideal way. How i did this was create a div class called row and one called column.




Users should be able to:

- View content in strictly a desktop display
- Click the red button which says read more

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned on how svgs are used and how useful they can be, other things i've learned is the proper way of formatting navs on the top right, and along with positioning 
flexboxes which consists of both row and column child classes.

The code below is the CSS to reference on how i made the row and column in a child class:

--css--

.row{

    display: flex;
    flex-flow: row;
}


.column{

    display: flex;
    flex-flow: column;
    gap: 28px;
    margin-top: 24px;
}




### Continued development

From this point on, i will continue to develop my skils of formatting items using css properties (mainly flexbox), formatting items just the way i wish for it
to be is one skill that i would like to perfect in the coming future. 




### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1]([https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp) - This helped me for making the red button, I really liked this simplistic way of creating a button and will use it again going forward.
